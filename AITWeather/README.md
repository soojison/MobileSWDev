# AITWeather
Assignment #3 for AIT-Budapest Spring 2017 Mobile Development course

## Features
* Making API calls to OpenWeatherMap for weather details
* List of interest cities in Main view
* Persistent Storage using Realm
* Relatively responsive layout for weather details (see screenshots)
* Handles queries that are not city names (see screenshots)
* Handles network timeout error (see screenshots)
* Customize units (metric/imperial) in the settings
* Maps fragment for the given Longitude and Latitude of the query city

## Bugs / future ideas
* Not sure why getWindDirection is too complex a method for IntelliJ to analyze
    :/
* User should be able to search for a real city using Google Maps
* User should be able to refresh the details screen for a newer result
